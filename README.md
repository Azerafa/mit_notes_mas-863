# MAS 863 - Notes and Assignments

I'm very excited to have access to a handful of MIT courses that are part of the Media Lab graduate course catalog! I'll be "taking" these classes to see if this program is a good fit for my interests and to learn more about subjects I'm passionate about!

There are 17 classes in the schedule for this course, so my notes will be broken down into 17 sections. I've decided to make these notes public so that I have an accessible record of what I've learned and as an attempt to keep my self-learning a bit more organized. 

As this is a fabrication course by nature there may be many things I can't actually do at home, so I will try my best to do assignments that require equipment in a different way while still paying attention to the intended process. 

Let's learn how to make some cool things!!
