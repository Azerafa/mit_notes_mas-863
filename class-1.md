# Class  1

Since the lectures are posted publicly I assume its ok to link it here, so here is the intro lecture I followed along with! [https://vimeo.com/454404886](https://vimeo.com/454404886)&#x20;

Right off of the bat I'm intimidated by the application process, even though it doesn't pertain to me as I'm not gunning for shop space haha, maybe some day. I'm hoping I can still get a lot out of this course without having access to the hardware!

I'm trying to simply listen and absorb since this is just the intro, but I did want to note a statement that stuck out to me - in this class you don't learn to use arduinos you learn to make one. I think that's a good differentiator from the prototyping class I took in Uni, and a reassurance that it will be valuable to watch each of these lessons! &#x20;
